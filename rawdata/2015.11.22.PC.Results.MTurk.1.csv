I felt I needed to address how Jamie was using the company's things for personal use instead of using them for the work the company does. When I confronted Jamie, she got upset with me because she felt as if the materials the company had bought for her to use at work belonged to her and not to the rest of the company."	Jamie got upset with me.	Jamie did not want to stop misusing the property.	Jamie felt as if I had violated her rights.	Jamie told me she was not happy about having to only use company property for company use.	Jamie felt as if other people using the stuff the company had bought would violate her privacy.	I was quite frustrated during the conversation.	I felt better after having the conversation.	7	2	5	6	3	6	7	7	6	6	1	1	6	5	7	7	6	7	2	1	1	46.8914032	-96.92939758	-1
